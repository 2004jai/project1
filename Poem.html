        <h2 id="P1"> <i> <u> Dance Of Love</u></i></h2>
        <p>
            The day we danced, it was so sweet, <br>
Our bodies swayed to the love we'd meet, <br>
You were so close, I felt your heat, <br>
And time stopped still, under our feet.<br>
<br> 
Your hands on my shoulder, mine on your waist, <br>
My heart was pounding, a steady pace, <br>
As we moved to the music's grace, <br>
I glimpsed an angel, in your face.<br>
<br> 
Lost in the moment, we danced away, <br>
In an open field, where flowers sway, <br>
The wind blew gently, with hair astray,<br>
And I was lost in your eyes that day.<br>
<br> 
I didn't care about the teacher's rules, <br>
Or the other students, who played the fools, <br>
I only cared about the love in our grooves, <br>
And how I felt, in your beautiful view.<br>
<br>
But now that love is long gone, <br>
And all that's left, is a scarred song,<br> 
The memory of that dance lingers on, <br>
And I'll cherish it everyday till I'm gone .......<br> 
<br>

            <h2 id="P2"> <i> <u> Absence</u></i></h2>
            <p>
                In love's absence, pain runs deep,<br>
Unseen wounds, secrets we keep,<br>
Yet even if we part, my heart holds true,<br>
Feelings endure, forever for you.<br>
<br><br>
Gazing at the moon, a tender guide,<br>
Reminding me of lessons inside,<br>
Sent by God, you were meant to be,<br>
A chapter of love's destiny.<br>
<br><br>
I loved you then, and I love you still,<br>
A flame unyielding, against all will,<br>
Through distance and time, our bond remains,<br>
In eternal love's sacred domains.<br>
